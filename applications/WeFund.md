## Project Overview
 
 
### Overview
 
 
- **Name:** WeFund
- **Brief Description:** 
WeFund is a community crowdfunding incubator for blockchain and real-world projects built on various blockchains. WeFund has the capability to incubate and crowdfund diverse blockchain and real-world projects, bridging the gap between the real world and blockchain. WeFund has been developed to be a 360- degree incubation service for projects hosted on the WeFund platform through support and guidance before, during, and after funding has been completed.

- **Relationship to EOSIO:**
 Fast, easy to build, and C++ based is a big plus for us to build on EOSIO, what we can be is an Incubator process and launchpad for the coming soon EVM launch. We can host and help to prepare the future project that will join and be part of EOSIO.

- **Reason for Interest:** 
  - We are looking to implement many blockchains, including EOS, that align with our mission and community. Our goal is to focus on real-world projects that are looking to implement blockchain into their current model. This includes fintech, education, environmental, health tech, and more. We are rebuilding our platform (from Terra) to be multichain and build an efficient system to bridge Web2 users to Web3. WeFund believes EOS aligns with our mission of high-quality projects with real-world applications. WeFund will deliver an alternative launchpad for the EOS community with safeguards to minimise risks from failed projects through WeFund’s smart contract milestone system The free incubation services will assist in delivering more projects to the EOS network and community. WeFund is a community and crowdfunding-oriented project. This allows anyone to invest in early projects and explore the EOS network. This, in turn, would help the EOS network grow and support high-quality projects.

 
### Project Details
 
 
the MVP is online on www.wefund.app
 
 
1) What is the name of your project?
 
WeFund
 
2) What is the tagline for your project?
 
Community crowdfunding and incubation launchpad with a focus on real-world projects implementing blockchain in their existing model.
 
3) What product(s) or service(s) are you planning to launch, grow, or build with the support of SCF?
 
The projects on WeFund’s platform do all fundraising with stablecoins. In addition to this, all projects will have a dedicated smart contract that deposits stablecoin funds into the yield generator's savings protocol to generate yield. WeFund does not touch any of the funds raised. Each project will also follow a milestone fund release system managed by smart contract. The project will determine a set of milestones (with the WeFund team) that when completed will be voted on by the project investors. If the milestone is approved, the next set of funds will be automatically released to the project team to complete the next milestone. If the milestone is not approved, all remaining funds will be returned to the backers. This makes the crowdfunding process 100% transparent, holds project creators accountable, and minimises risk for investors. By using stablecoins, WeFund will be able to host projects built on other blockchains including Binance, Ethereum, Solana, and more. 
 
4) Your project/company is based in:
 
Dubai, United Arab Emirates
 
5) Where do you want to be in 6 months?*
 
In 6 months, we aim to have a fully functioning launchpad with a strong infrastructure and network for sustainable incubation. In 3 months, we aim to have 4 fundraising projects per month and 6-8 projects per month in 6 months' time. In addition to this, we will continue to make a strong effort to continue our community and user growth.
 
6) What will you do to accomplish this goal?*
  
Initially, WeFund was primarily focused on leveraging the Terra chain, however, with the failure of Terra, WeFund is rebuilding to be a multichain platform to leverage various stablecoins and easily transition Web2 users to Web3. WeFund has a broker licence in accordance with United Arab Emirates regulations. All funds are managed on blockchain and WeFund does not touch any funds raised. As regulations change in various regions, WeFund will remain agile to comply with any upcoming regulatory changes.

Additional support or freelance assistance is welcome to help us rebuild and scale the business.
 
Our goal is to focus on real-world projects that are looking to implement blockchain into their current model. This includes fintech, education, environmental, health tech, and more. We are currently rebuilding our platform (from Terra) to be multichain and build an efficient system to bridge Web2 users to Web3 
 
7) Project body
 
There are many cases in which projects backed by investors have malicious intent from the start and do not operate in good faith, therefore, failing investors. The China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) claims that only 8% of the over 80,000 blockchain projects ever launched are still active today. Furthermore, blockchain projects only average a lifespan of roughly 1.22 years. Additionally, a Wall Street Journal review of 1,450 documents for digital coin offerings unveiled 271 indicators of fraudulent tactics — including “plagiarised investor documents, promises of guaranteed returns, and missing or fake executive teams.”  To increase transparency, minimise risk, and hold projects accountable for the funds raised, WeFund has a unique community vetting and unique milestone system. This means the WeFund community will, at each milestone of a project’s development, vote as to whether the relevant milestone has been achieved, with the outcome of such vote determining the release of funds required for the project to achieve its next milestone. For example, if a project is looking to raise $50,000, the project creators will need to identify a series of milestones and their respective expected costs (WeFund can work with the project creators on this). For this example, we can assume this project will need $10,000 for platform development, $20,000 for marketing, and so on... Every project will have a dedicated smart contract that automatically deposits funds raised into yield generators, a stablecoin savings protocol. The first $10,000 will be released to the project creator to complete its first milestone within a predetermined period. When the milestone is complete, the investors of the project will vote whether or not this meets their expectations. If the milestone is approved, the next set of funds, in this example $20,000, will be automatically released to the project creators. If the milestone is not approved, the remaining funds will be returned to the investors. With this system and the use of smart contracts, WeFund does not touch any of the funds raised and the entire fundraising process is transparent.
 
#### TARGET MARKET                    
WeFund can host projects being built on any ecosystem. With this in mind, WeFund primarily focuses on projects that are looking to implement blockchain technology into an existing, real-world model. WeFund’s user base is mainly intermediate crypto enthusiasts looking to be early investors in crypto/blockchain projects that will not only have strong financial returns but have a meaningful impact. WeFund has a community of nearly 12,000 on Twitter and Telegram.

Our addressable market (TAM) is $10 billion USD (Source: Grandview Research)
    
#### REVENUE MODEL        
Yield Generators (nexo,coinloan, stargate,zengo,blockfi, etc) - WeFund does not take a fee or commission from the incubation and fundraising process. Instead, all yield generated from multiple yield generators, a stablecoin savings protocols, will be for WeFund. So projects will get 100% of the funds raised. The average of yield generates 6-10% APY.
Transaction Fee - There will be a 1-5% transaction fee charged toward project backers
Advertising (upcoming) - As WeFund scales, we will accept payment to push projects via social media and media releases. 
    
#### SALES FORECAST/FINANCIAL PLAN
Financial Forecasts.xlsx    
            
#### INDUSTRY AND MARKET RESEARCH                    
The Blockchain market size (TAM) is projected to grow from $4.9 billion in 2021 to $67.4 billion by 2026. The major driving factors contributing to the high growth rate of the blockchain market include increasing venture capital funding and investment in blockchain technology; extensive use of blockchain solutions in banking and cybersecurity; high adoption of blockchain solutions for payment, smart contracts, and digital identities; and rising government initiatives. By WeFund’s estimation, blockchain impact on the real world would be ~75% of the TAM, or $3.675 billion (SOM). WeFund aims to achieve ~10% of the SOM or $367.5 million as an addressable market.
 
#### THREATS AND OPPORTUNITIES
WeFund has a broker licence in accordance with United Arab Emirates regulations. All funds are managed on blockchain and WeFund does not touch any funds raised. As regulations change in various regions, WeFund will remain agile to comply with any upcoming regulatory changes. In addition to this, WeFund was previously built on the Terra blockchain as the crash caused WeFund to lose most of its development traction. To counter this, WeFund is implementing a multi-chain system to diversify blockchain risk.
 
#### COMPETITION 
There are many launchpads available, and many successful ones, however, WeFund sets itself apart in several ways
Milestone fund release system managed by smart contract for 100% transparency, minimize risk for investors, and hold project creators accountable.
Focus on blockchain projects with real-world applications
Do not ask for any fee or commission for incubation and funds raised. Projects do not pay any money to WeFund
Does not require users to hold WeFund’s native token to invest in projects
Multi-chain, stablecoin crowdfunding
Secure and refundable deposits if a project fails during milestone
Competitive Landscape.xlsx
 
#### MARKETING AND  SALES        
Strategic Partnerships - Establishing strategic partnerships with other launchpads, accelerators, institutional investors, exchanges, and more. These partnerships expand our network for the projects WeFund hosts, improve media coverage, and give the WeFund project more credibility. 

Social Media - WeFund is very active on social media platforms including Twitter, Telegram, Discord, and Medium. Twitter, Telegram, and Discord are efficient tools to make announcements and directly engage with our community. WeFund leverages Medium to self-publish articles related to new partnerships and development updates in WeFund. Finally, WeFund leverages YouTube to publish video content such as AMAs with projects that will be on the WeFund platform.
